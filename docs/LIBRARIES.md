# LM-8 Libraries

Several assembly library files are included in the `programs/libraries` directory to provide commonly used
functionality.

## Math
As the name would imply, this library provides math utility functions for performing common calculations.
Currently, provides subroutines for modulus and multiplication. 

## Serial
This library has subroutines for initializing the UART serial pins and printing null terminated strings
out over serial. Uses Arduino pin 0 for RX and pin 1 for TX. 

## SPI
The SPI library provides utility subroutines for initializing the SPI pins and transferring data with an
SPI slave device. The SPI data transfer requires 3 wires and uses GPIO pins `4`, `5`, and `6`. These 
handle communicating with a selected device, but the caller is responsible for selecting said device by
setting a pin responsible for that device's chip-select line low. 

## SD Card
The SD library handles interacting with an SDHC or SDXC card over SPI. Only modern cards are supported to
simplify the block addressing code. The library allows for easily initializing the SD card, retrieving
card info, and requesting block reads. See the Bootloader program example usage. Filesystems are not
supported due to the complexity, so data must be directly written to the card by means such as flashing
an image generated by the Assembler with the `memory` flag using Etcher.

## I2C
Coming soon.
