# Custom Computer
This project is a custom 8-bit computer architecture comprised of an Assembler, an Emulator,
a Logisim-Evolution simulation, and an FPGA implementation.

## Usage
To assemble one of the test programs, run:
``` python
python assembler.py programs/<program>.asm
```
To run an assembled ROM, either run the emulator with the ROM filename as a parameter or
run the emulator and browse and open a ROM. See the emulator project's README for compilation
instructions.
